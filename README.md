# PAMA-beta /*-/* a robot try to walk
Prototype of Auto MAchine This is a prototype of autonomous machine built to test and verify the platform, designing, planning, making, debugging process. 
Currently, we have got the PAMA some basic excercise motion and interact function. Like standing, up-down squat. 
We hope it be a robot able to walk as human, go up-down stairs in real environment in the future. 
Those code was developing and debugging through a Raspberry Pi 4 Computer to a RP2040 hub board with micro Python. 
The body frame of PAMA was assembled by FDM 3D printing parts. And driven and actuated by motor servo. 
While this beta version get much test on what we set, we look forward to add more mainstream tech into next version like ROS2，VEM（vector environment modeling）, to achieve a more intelligent and humanlike machine。 
The main frame of code and 3D body was provided. 
Any question is welcomed.
